# MERN Stack - E-commerce project

Created e-commerce style project using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. For the last 10 years of my professional career I have worked in e-commerce environments and I wanted to take some time to build the framework for a online store.

Metropolitan Survival Store is an online store that specializes in survival gear specifically for customers in the northwest. Why stock up on water when you can buy a 55 galloon drum of hand sanitizer. MSS only carries the most essential items for NW customers.
